# OpenDOS
All companies seem to be busy making GUI operating systems because they're big and they have a lot to lose.
But what if I make DOS? A have absolutely nothing to lose!
# info
OpenDOS commands are regular batch commands, but the only commands available at the 21.1 (1.0!) release are:

CLS            Clears the screen.
ECHO           Displays messages.
SHUTDOWN       Shut down machine.
REBOOT         restart machine.

and of course the HELP command.
# code
all OpenDOS code is in Kernel.cs
If you would like to edit the code, download COSMOS and its prequisites.
